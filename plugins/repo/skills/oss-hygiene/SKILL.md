# oss-hygiene

Brings a public GitHub repo up to the **GitHub Community Standards** baseline and the **OpenSSF Scorecard** supply-chain baseline, and stages it for the **OpenSSF Best Practices Badge**.

This sits next to `/gh-bootstrap` and answers a different question: gh-bootstrap locks the merge surface; oss-hygiene fills the contributor-facing and supply-chain surface.

## Where this skill fits

| Concern | Skill |
|---|---|
| Merge button, branch protection, release-notes config | `/gh-bootstrap` |
| Community files, supply-chain checks, OSSF posture | **`/oss-hygiene`** (this skill) |
| Org-wide settings as code across many repos | `/safe-settings` |
| Per-task PR / issue / CI ops | `/gh` |

Run `/gh-bootstrap` first (so `main` is locked), then `/oss-hygiene` (so contributors can find their way in and supply-chain checks gate PRs).

## What gets configured

The skill operates on three orthogonal surfaces. It diffs every file against `assets/` templates and asks before overwriting anything that already exists.

### Surface 1 — GitHub Community Standards

The "Community Standards" tab under repo Insights surfaces these files. Missing files fail the checklist.

| File | Source asset | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | (not scaffolded — repo has its own) | Surface check only |
| `LICENSE` | (not scaffolded — choose-a-license decision) | Surface check only |
| `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` | `assets/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` | Contributor Covenant 2.1 |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | `assets/CONTRIBUTING.md` | How to file issues, open PRs, run tests |
| `SECURITY.md` | `assets/SECURITY.md` | Vulnerability reporting (private advisory) |
| `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml` | `assets/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml` | Structured bug form |
| `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml` | `assets/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml` | Structured feature form |
| `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` | `assets/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` | Disable blank issues, contact links |
| `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` | `assets/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` | PR checklist |

For LICENSE: if missing, do **not** silently scaffold. License choice is a decision (`MIT`, `Apache-2.0`, `AGPL-3.0`, etc.) — surface the gap and link the user to <https://choosealicense.com/>.

For README: surface a missing-or-thin warning but do not auto-generate. README content is the project's voice.

### Surface 2 — Supply chain (Scorecard checks)

OpenSSF Scorecard runs ~18 automated checks. The skill wires the ones that are scaffold-shaped:

| Scorecard check | Risk | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `Security-Policy` | Medium | `SECURITY.md` (Surface 1) |
| `License` | Low | `LICENSE` (Surface 1, surface only) |
| `Dependency-Update-Tool` | High | `assets/.github/dependabot.yml` |
| `Branch-Protection` | High | covered by `/gh-bootstrap` ruleset |
| `Code-Review` | High | covered by `/gh-bootstrap` PR rule |
| `CI-Tests` | Low | repo's existing CI |
| `Token-Permissions` | High | audit existing workflows for `permissions:` blocks; report only |
| `Dangerous-Workflow` | Critical | audit only — warn on `pull_request_target` + `actions/checkout` of head ref |
| `SAST` | Medium | `assets/.github/workflows/codeql.yml` (when applicable) |
| `Pinned-Dependencies` | Medium | report only — pinning is per-ecosystem and contentious |
| `Maintained` | High | passive — emerges from real activity |
| `Binary-Artifacts` | High | scan for `.so`, `.dll`, `.jar`, `.exe`, `.zip`, `.tgz` in tree; warn |
| `Vulnerabilities` | High | passive — Dependabot alerts handle it |
| `Signed-Releases` | High | report only — sigstore wiring is project-specific |
| `Fuzzing` | Medium | report only — language-specific |
| `Packaging` | Medium | report only — depends on release pipeline |
| `Contributors` | Low | passive |
| `CII-Best-Practices` | Low | Surface 3 |

Plus the GitHub-native Code Security features that **don't go in repo files**:

| Feature | How to enable | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Dependabot alerts | Repo Settings → Advanced Security (auto-on for public) | verify via API |
| Secret scanning alerts (for users) | Repo Settings → Advanced Security (free public, opt-in) | enable via API |
| Push protection (secret scanning) | Repo Settings → Advanced Security | enable via API |
| Dependency graph | Repo Settings → Security (auto-on for public) | verify via API |
| Dependency Review Action | `assets/.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml` | scaffold |
| Scorecard publishing | `assets/.github/workflows/scorecard.yml` | scaffold (uploads SARIF for the badge) |

### Surface 3 — OpenSSF Best Practices Badge

The badge is **self-attested** at <https://www.bestpractices.dev>. The skill doesn't fill it out — the project owner has to. What the skill does:

1. Checks whether the repo already has a badge (looks for the badge URL in README).
2. Prints the registration link with the repo URL pre-filled.
3. Suggests adding the badge markdown to README (`assets/README-badge-snippet.md`).

The badge is a Scorecard `CII-Best-Practices` check enabler — registering even at the in-progress level is the lowest-effort way to bump that score.

## Protocol

### 1. Confirm scope and inspect current state

```bash
gh auth status
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner,visibility,isPrivate,licenseInfo,description
gh api "repos/$REPO/community/profile" --jq '{
  health_percentage,
  files: (.files | to_entries | map(select(.value != null)) | from_entries | keys)
}'
gh api "repos/$REPO/vulnerability-alerts" 2>/dev/null && echo "dependabot alerts: ON" || echo "dependabot alerts: OFF"
gh api "repos/$REPO" --jq '{
  secret_scanning: .security_and_analysis.secret_scanning.status,
  push_protection: .security_and_analysis.secret_scanning_push_protection.status
}'
```

Ask the user — **once, as a single consolidated question** with all decisions inline. Do not prompt sequentially; the user should be able to reply "go with defaults" and have the skill proceed. Cap the list at the items below (≤5):

- Visibility — this skill is sized for **public** repos. Private repos can use a subset (community files yes, secret scanning needs Advanced Security, scorecard publishing needs public visibility for the badge).
- License — if `licenseInfo` is null, surface and stop until the user picks one.
- CodeQL applicability — does the repo contain code in a CodeQL-supported language (`actions`, `c-cpp`, `csharp`, `go`, `java-kotlin`, `javascript-typescript`, `python`, `ruby`, `swift`)? If not, skip the CodeQL workflow. **Surface a recommendation, don't force a question** when the only matches are CI-helper scripts (e.g. `.github/scripts/*.py`) — those are not project code, and the default should be skip with the user opting in.
- FUNDING.yml — does the user accept sponsorship? If yes, ask for platform + handle (GitHub Sponsors, Buy Me a Coffee, Ko-fi, OpenCollective, etc.).
- CODEOWNERS — only suggest when the repo has multiple maintainers. For solo, skip.

### 2. Scaffold the community files

For each file under `assets/`, in order:

```text
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
CONTRIBUTING.md
SECURITY.md
.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml
.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml
.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml
.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
```

Diff against the existing file (if present). If different, ask before overwriting. Substitute `{{REPO}}`, `{{OWNER}}`, `{{CONTACT_EMAIL}}` placeholders.

`CONTRIBUTING.md` includes a generic skeleton — encourage the user to project-specific-ize it after merge.

### 3. Scaffold the supply-chain workflows

| Asset | Target | When to skip |
|---|---|---|
| `assets/.github/dependabot.yml` | `.github/dependabot.yml` | never (always useful) |
| `assets/.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml` | `.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml` | private repo without Code Security |
| `assets/.github/workflows/scorecard.yml` | `.github/workflows/scorecard.yml` | private repo (badge needs public) |
| `assets/.github/workflows/codeql.yml` | `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` | repo has no CodeQL-supported language |

`dependabot.yml` is configured with the language packages detected in the repo (look for `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Gemfile`, `composer.json`, `pom.xml`, etc.) plus a `github-actions` ecosystem entry to keep workflow action versions current.

**Manifest detection scope.** Only count manifests in project source roots — *not* under `.github/scripts/`, `.devcontainer/`, `tools/ci/`, or other CI-helper paths. A `pyproject.toml` under a project root is real; a hard-coded `pip install foo==1.2.3` line in a workflow is not, and Dependabot can't track it without a real top-level manifest. When the only language presence is CI-helper code, **skip that ecosystem** and add a one-line comment in the generated `dependabot.yml` explaining why (e.g. "no top-level Python manifest; the only Python is in `.github/scripts/`"). This mirrors the same heuristic used for CodeQL applicability in step 1.

### 4. Toggle the GitHub-native security features

Use `gh api` to enable or verify (idempotent — re-applying is a no-op):

```bash
# Automated security fixes / Dependabot security updates
gh api -X PUT "repos/$REPO/automated-security-fixes"

# Vulnerability alerts (Dependabot alerts)
gh api -X PUT "repos/$REPO/vulnerability-alerts"

# Secret scanning alerts for users + push protection
gh api -X PATCH "repos/$REPO" \
  -F security_and_analysis[secret_scanning][status]=enabled \
  -F security_and_analysis[secret_scanning_push_protection][status]=enabled
```

For private repos these may 403 unless GitHub Code Security is paid for — surface and skip rather than fail.

### 5. Audit existing workflows for Token-Permissions and Dangerous-Workflow

This is **detection**, not modification. The skill reads each `.github/workflows/*.yml`:

- **Token-Permissions:** flag any workflow without a top-level `permissions:` block (or with `permissions: write-all`). Suggest the safe default `permissions: { contents: read }` and bump only what each job needs.
- **Dangerous-Workflow:** flag the unsafe pattern of `pull_request_target` + `actions/checkout` of the head SHA, and any `${{ ... }}` interpolation of `github.event.*` inputs into shell scripts.

Print findings; don't auto-edit. These are subtle changes the user should review.

### 6. Surface the OpenSSF Best Practices Badge step

Print, don't apply. Substitute `<owner>`, `<repo>`, and the project ID once registered. Read `assets/README-badge-snippet.md` and **strip the block between `<!-- BEGIN-CODEQL -->` and `<!-- END-CODEQL -->` markers when CodeQL was skipped in step 3** — the markers exist precisely so the snippet is conditionally trimmable without ambiguity.

```text
Register at: https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/projects/new
Repo URL:    https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>
Once you have a project ID, paste this into README.md:

[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.scorecard.dev/projects/github.com/<owner>/<repo>/badge)](https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/<owner>/<repo>)
[![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/<id>/badge)](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/<id>)
```

The skill does not register the project for the user — registration is a credential and judgment step (the user attests answers).

### 7. Verify and report

Re-read the community profile and the workflow files. Print a small summary:

```bash
gh api "repos/$REPO/community/profile" --jq '{health_percentage, missing: ([.files | to_entries[] | select(.value == null) | .key])}'
ls .github/workflows/ | sort
```

The summary should call out:

- What was scaffolded (and the diff vs existing if any)
- What was already correct (no-op)
- What was skipped and why (no LICENSE, private repo, no CodeQL languages, etc.)
- The OSSF badge registration link

## Idempotency

- Files: diff before overwriting; ask if the content differs.
- API toggles: `PUT`/`PATCH` are idempotent.
- Workflow audit: read-only — re-running just re-prints the same findings.
- Never delete: if a previous run left an artifact (an old workflow with a different name), surface it and let the user decide.

## What this skill is NOT for

- License selection — it surfaces the gap, doesn't pick one
- README authoring — content is the project's voice
- Org-wide community files — use `/safe-settings` for that
- Branch protection / merge queue — use `/gh-bootstrap`
- Sigstore release signing — language- and pipeline-specific, out of scope
- Filling out the OSSF Best Practices Badge questionnaire — that's the maintainer's attestation
- Pinning dependencies — per-ecosystem, often contentious
- Setting up fuzzing — language-specific

## Gotchas

- **Default community health files**: if the user/org has a `.github` repo with these files, they apply to *every* repo without its own copy. Scaffolding into a repo overrides the org default; only do it when per-repo overrides are intended.
- **Dependency Review Action**: works on **public** repos for free, and on private repos only with **GitHub Advanced Security**. The workflow will hard-fail on private/free.
- **Scorecard workflow**: needs `id-token: write` for OIDC publishing to scorecard.dev; the asset has the right permissions. If the workflow fails on first run with a 403, the user has org-level OIDC restrictions.
- **CodeQL setup-mode**: `default` setup is configured in the GitHub UI (Settings → Code security → CodeQL → Set up). The asset uses `advanced` setup (workflow file). The two are mutually exclusive — if the user enabled default first, the workflow file will conflict.
- **Token-Permissions audit**: actions like `softprops/action-gh-release` and many publish actions need `contents: write`. Don't tell users to set every workflow to read-only — flag and explain.
- **`pull_request_target` is dangerous by default**: don't use it just to access secrets in fork PRs. The skill flags it; the user should refactor to a separate `workflow_run` or labeled-PR pattern.
- **OSSF badge is self-attested**: a passing badge means the maintainer answered the questions, not that an audit happened. It's a signal, not a guarantee.
- **Scorecard score on tiny / new repos**: the `Maintained` check needs 90 days of activity; new repos will score low until they age in. This is a feature, not a bug.
- **Scaffolded workflows trip `Pinned-Dependencies` against themselves**: `dependency-review.yml`, `scorecard.yml`, and `codeql.yml` use floating tags (`@v4`, `@v2`, `@v3`) to match the OSSF reference templates and stay readable. Scorecard's `Pinned-Dependencies` check will flag this on the first run. The intentional trade-off: Dependabot (also scaffolded by this skill) keeps the tags green automatically, whereas SHA pins decay silently. If you want a clean Pinned-Dependencies score, convert the three new workflow files to commit-SHA pins after the first Dependabot PR lands — Dependabot will then maintain them in pinned form.
